# Citizen Code of Conduct---this is just placeholder text! please edit :)

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of D4D Ambassador is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in D4d Ambassador to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

We are Inclusive.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society and upon which many of our institutions are built.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise inclusivity, equity, consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from racist, sexist, ageist, ageist, demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior  and speech. This includes, but is not limited to, any and all forms of shaming, erasure, and victim blaming.
 * Not all opinions are equal - we do not entertain, support or allow any expression/action of white supremacy, white feminism, exclusionary radical feminism of any kind, anti-semitism, any kind of apologism, and the use of ableist language.  
 * Ask for permission and obtain consent before you send others private messages.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your co-participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone being targeted, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).  

## 7. Grounds for immediate removal  

Threats, violence, hate speech, harrassment or any other behavior deemed by the admins to have caused damage or distress to the group are grounds for immediate removal.  

## 8. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. .



Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 9. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Data4Democracy with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.



## 10. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
